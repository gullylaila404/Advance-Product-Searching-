# 🔍 Advanced Product Search System

An intelligent product search engine inspired by modern e-commerce platforms, built using **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and connected with a **SQL Server** backend. This project simulates advanced search functionalities with real-time filters and indexing for improved performance.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔎 Multiple Search Techniques:
- **Prefix Search** – Using Trie for autocomplete suggestions  
- **Exact Match Search** – Hash Table-based matching  
- **Category, Brand, and Price Filtering** – Efficient data filtering using arrays/lists  
- **Keyword-Based Search** – Inverted Index implementation  
- **Product ID Lookup** – Fast direct retrieval  
- **Price Range Search** – Using Binary Search or Bisect logic  

### 🧩 Core Functionalities:
- Add, edit, delete, and view product details (CRUD)  
- Admin login dashboard for product management  
- Customer login & registration  
- View/search products with advanced filters  
- Compare products by price and rating  
- Handle typos and incomplete inputs using fuzzy matching

## 📊 Data Visualizations *(Planned / Optional)*:
- Bar charts for price comparison (Plotly/Seaborn supported)  
- Pie charts for product availability or category distribution  
- Tables for structured product view  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Apply custom DSA techniques in real-world search scenarios  
- Build efficient search engine logic using OOP principles  
- Connect backend logic with a structured SQL Server database  
- Turn theoretical classroom learning into a working application
